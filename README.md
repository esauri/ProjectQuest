# Dungeon Game
## Dungeon Game built using C# and WPF on Visual Studio
### Spring 2014
Traverse through a 2D dungeon maze. Find tomes which teach you fundamental spells to cast fire balls, lightning bolts, or heal yourself. Encounter vicious enemies such as Goblins who travel in packs, or Orc Warlords who roam to protect their domain. On some occasions you might come across a death rider who haunts the dungeon halls for souls to collect.
